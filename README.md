# Foreground and background extraction in images with green background
This notebook uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for background and foreground extraction in images with green background. Please refer to the paper Segment Anything by Alexander Kirillov et al. for more information about the model.

SAM is actually a very powerful segmentation model that can produce high-quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes. It can also generate masks for all objects in an image. It has been trained on a dataset of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks and has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of segmentation tasks.
